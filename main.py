# The above code is the main file that runs the quiz game. It uses the classes and functions from the other files to create
# the quiz game. The main file imports the Question class from question_model.py, the question_data from data.py, the
# QuizBrain class from quiz_brain.py, and the QuizInterface class from ui.py. It then creates a list of Question objects
# using the question_data, creates a QuizBrain object using the list of questions, and creates a QuizInterface object to
# display the quiz game to the user. The main file then runs the quiz game and prints the final score to the console.Â±
